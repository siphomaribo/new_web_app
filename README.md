# new_web_app

A new Flutter web project.

## First Part

- It took me an 45min to Download Android SKD
- It took me an hour 30min to
  - Read about Flutter
  - How to intergrate Choco, Dart and Flutter
  - Application of all the tools and run the app

## Second Part
- Removed the default context on the web page and added a button that currently does nothing (took about 15min-20min to do so)
- Used Flutter theming module to configure the button style and also played around with the them (This took me about 20min)
- Implementing the functionality 1hour 20min
  - I started by creating a structure (added a folder called providers and added a class there)
  - Inside the class, I wrote the functionality that does the increment
  - I called the provider in my UI
    - This in particular took the longest because I had to do some reading and modfied my code as I go along
